# MathWise
MathWise is an Interactive math expression editor with a handwriting recognition system which aims to convert handwritten mathematical expressions to formats that are compatible with formal documentation platforms and provide accurate solutions for the recognized and validated expressions. Based on these recognized math expressions, the aim is to convert these expressions into meaningful formats that can be used for documentation purposes (e.g. LaTeX). The system also attempts to solve the recognized mathematical expression and provide accurate solutions for the same.
